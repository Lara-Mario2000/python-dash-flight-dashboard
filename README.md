# Flight Routes Dashboard

![Alt text](src\dashboard.png)

## Description

This project is an interactive web application built with **Dash** that allows users to visualize and filter flight routes on an interactive map and in a data table. The app provides tools for exploring flight routes by selecting filters such as airlines, origin and destination airports, arrival dates, and time ranges.

## Features

- **Flight route visualization:** Displays an interactive map with flight routes between airports.
- **Filter by airline, origin, and destination:** Allows users to select and view specific flights by airline and airports.
- **Select arrival date and time:** Filters flights based on the arrival date and time range.
- **Interactive data table:** Displays the filtered flights in a table that updates in real-time based on selected filters.
- **Dynamic map:** Generates a dynamic map of flight routes with markers for origin and destination airports, connected by lines representing the selected routes.

## Technologies used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Dash:** Framework for building interactive web applications.
- **Plotly:** For interactive data visualizations.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Folium:** For visualizing flight routes on an interactive map.
- **Bootstrap:** For the UI design.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You may need the following libraries:
   - Dash
   - Plotly
   - Pandas
   - Folium
   - Bootstrap (via CDN)

2. Ensure the flight data file `data.csv` is in the correct path:

   ```bash
   /scripts/flights/data.csv
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. When the app starts, you'll see a map with all available flight routes by default.
2. Use the filters on the left side of the screen to:
   - Select one or more airlines.
   - Filter by origin and destination airports.
   - Choose a specific arrival day using the date slider.
   - Adjust the arrival time range with the `RangeSlider`.
3. The flight table and interactive map will automatically update based on the selected filters.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main code for the Dash application.
- `data.csv`: CSV file containing flight data (airline, origin, destination, dates, coordinates, etc.).
- `flight_routes_week_map.html`: HTML file generated by Folium with the flight routes map.

## Future Improvements

- Add another window for displaying the best-priced flight routes.
- Integrate real-time flight data for live updates.
